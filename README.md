# dot_config
I largely use this for syncing my config files across machines.<br>
You can use these as examples of how to configure tmux/neovim.<br>
The way I use them is I clone the repo and then ln -s the ~/.config/nvim directory and the ~/tmux.conf<br>
Since I'm prone to making changes you may wish to fork or just copy.<br>

Tmux-leader key is Ctrl-Space<br>
NeoVim-leader key is Space
