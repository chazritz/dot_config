# dot_config
I largely use this for syncing my config files across machines.<br>
You can use these as examples of how to configure tmux/neovim.<br>
The way I use them is I clone the repo and then ln -s the ~/.config/nvim directory and the ~/tmux.conf<br>
Since I'm prone to making changes you may wish to fork or just copy.<br>

Tmux-leader key is Ctrl-Space<br>
NeoVim-leader key is Space

For the .zshrc file, you will need the following tools installed ( they are useful ) 
homebrew ( if using macOS ) 
vivid ( for themable ls colors )
carapace ( for general command line tab-autocompletion )
fzf ( for fuzzy finding history, files, etc Ctrl-R, Ctrl-T)
starship ( for pretty prompt )
