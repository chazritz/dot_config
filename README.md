# dot_config
~/.config

I largely use this for syncing my config files across machines.
You can use these as examples of how to configure tmux/neovim.
The way I use them is I clone the repo and then ln -s the ~/.config/nvim directory and the ~/tmux.conf
Since I'm prone to making changes you may wish to fork or just copy.

Tmux-leader key is Ctrl-Space
NeoVim-leader key is Space
